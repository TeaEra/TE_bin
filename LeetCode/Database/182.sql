/*
	PROBLEM: Duplicate Emails

Write a SQL query to find all duplicate emails in a table named Person.

+----+---------+
| Id | Email   |
+----+---------+
| 1  | a@b.com |
| 2  | c@d.com |
| 3  | a@b.com |
+----+---------+
For example, your query should return the following for the above table:

+---------+
| Email   |
+---------+
| a@b.com |
+---------+
Note: All emails are in lowercase.

SELECT Email FROM
(SELECT Email, COUNT(Id) AS cnt FROM Person GROUP BY Email) AS a
WHERE a.cnt > 1;
